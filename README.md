# Price-Prediction-of-used-Cars
**With the help of good amount of data of used cars scraped from spinny.com using selenium library, the project involves intensive feature engineering using numpy & pandas, finally giving way to implementing Machine Learning using a Linear Regression Model. The model shows accuracy of more than 80% and is able to reliably give a meaningful prediction of prices of used cars in India.**
