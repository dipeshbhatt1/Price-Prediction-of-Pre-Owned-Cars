# Prediction of prices of Used Cars (Python)

**The idea behind this project was to build a smart Machine Learning model that could help- 1. A buyer to know a reasonable price of a used car based on his desired features, and 2. A seller to get a reliable idea of the current value of their used car. For this, data of more than 1000 used cars, scraped from spinny.com using selenium, was used which required intensive feature engineering, data manipulation & visualisation, using numpy, pandas, seaborn, finally giving way to creating a Linear Regression Model. 
The model shows accuracy of more than 80% and is able to reliably provide a meaningful prediction of prices of used cars in India.**
