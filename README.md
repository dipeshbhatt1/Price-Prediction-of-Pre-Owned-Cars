## üìù Description
* This repository represents **"Price-Prediction using a Multiple Linear Regression Model"**
* With the help of this project we can meaningfully and reliably predict prices of pre-owned cars based on their features.

## ‚è≥ Dataset 
* Data of over 6000 pre-owned cars was extracted from spinny.com
* After applying feature engineering and data preparation we are left with data of over 1000 pre-owned cars
* Download the dataset for custom training:

## :gear: Setup
1. Install latest version of python:
    https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. If pip is not installed, you can follow the instructions:
    https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/
3. Install jupyter using command prompt:
```bash
    pip install jupyter
```
4. Install python libraries viz. numpy, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, selenium, sklearn and time, one-by-one using command prompt:
```bash
    pip install numpy
```
5. Once you have these all, launch the Jupyter Notebook using command prompt:
```bash
    jupyter notebook
```
6. Now you can start working on the project using the given dataset and python codes

1. **Objective:** To build a Machine Learning model (Linear Regression) that can predict prices (label) of used cars based on various features
2. **Data Collection:** For this, a reasonable and large enough dataset was required. Now, instead of looking for some old data or sample data available on internet, I decided to scrape website of a service provider already working in this field. So, I came across spinny.com which has a simple yet cool UI. Finally, the data was scrapped from this website.
3. **Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering:** Initially the dataset had all the data in just 7 columns, the data had null values, duplicates and noise too. After applying techniques like Data Cleaning (imputation, outlier detection, and removing duplicate records), EDA, and Feature Generation, total 14 meaningful features were generated, which can be used for drawing insites through aggregations and visualistion. Then, I applied some final techniques, to prepare final data for training the model, like Feature Selection, Feature Encoding, Feature Scaling. The final dataset has the following features:
```bash
    model (year)
    km driven (in thousands)
    mileage (in kmpl)
    seating capacity (units)
    fuel_type_ Petrol
    fuel_type_ Diesel
    fuel_type_ Petrol+cng
    transmission_ Automatic
    transmission_ Manual
    ground clearance (in mm)
    boot space (in litres)
    fuel tank capacity (in litres)
    max power (in bhp)
```
4. **Data Analysis and Visualisation:** Meanwhile data analysis through groupby, pivot table and aggregate funtions was also done and the data was visualised (screenshots may be referred).
5. **Training:** The final dataset was then split into training and testing datasets and trained through Linear Regression.
6. **Testing:** The predicted values for the label (price) were then generated. The accuracy came out to be 85% using R2 score metric and 84% using Adjusted R2 score method.
7. **Predicting (Applying the Model):** As a test case, predicting the price of a used car using hypothetical features seems to be quite reasonable and meaningful. The model now can be used by a user who may be buyer/seller to predict prices of pre-owned cars.

   1. North America And Europe have the highest average electrification in both rural and urban areas as they are among highly developed regions in the world. 
Regions belonging to lower and lower middle income have comparatively lower electrification along with considerable difference of distribution between rural and urban areas.
   
   2. There is gradual increase in number of developing countries accomplishing minimum 75% electrification over the last two decades.
   
   3. Developed regions have increased their electricity production through nuclear sources whereas some developing regions have gradually started increasing their foothold in nuclear power generation while some regions have been unable to do so.
   
   4. Transmission loss has been highest among the countries having poor economy, political instability , infrastructure issues and outdated technologies.
   
   5. Countries having emphasis on tourism , geographical & demographic constraint have seen highest growth rate of electrification in the last two decades.
   
   6. Higher income region have been in forefront of increasing renewable energy production along with nuclear sources whereas middle and lower middle countries are in gradual process.
